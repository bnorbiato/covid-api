# covid-api

in this project the api covid19 (https://api.covid19api.com) was used to track cases worldwide.

LANGUAGES USED
- JavaScript
- PHP
- HTML
- CSS

USAGE
at the beginning there are cards that show the global information of cases, deaths and recoveries (PHP). we also have information about care and symptoms (JavaScript).
on the page "countries" there is a list of all countries and their numbers on covid19 infections. you can search by the name of the country (or a portion of the name) or by numbers (JavaScript).

WHY THIS API?
this is a free api: didn't need a key to use. even returning only a list of countries and all the numbers, the api can show the evolution of the pandemic in the world.
also served as a study for integrating api and code.
