# covid-api

in this project the api covid19 (https://api.covid19api.com) was used to tracker cases worldwide.

LANGUAGES USEDS
- JavaScript
- PHP
- HTML
- CSS

USAGE
at the beginning we have cards that show the global information of cases, deaths and recoveries (PHP). we also have information about care and symptoms (JavaScript).
on the page "countries" we have a list of all countries and their numbers on covid19 infections. you can do a search with the name of the country, just a part of the word or with numbers (JavaScript).

WHY THIS API?
this is a free api: didn't need a key to use. even returning only a list of countries and all the numbers, the api can show the evolution of the pandemic in the world.
also served as a study for integrating api and code.
